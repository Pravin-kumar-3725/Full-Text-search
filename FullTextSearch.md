# __Full-Text Search__

Full-Text search is a search engine, which helps to find a word or text in database documents specified by an user. Full-text search has three types,

* Natural-language Full-Text Search
* Boolean Full-Text Search
* Query Full-Text Search

The process of full-text search involves two tasks, namely **_index_** and **_search_**.

#### __INDEX:__

Index is a process of listing all text or words related to the word specified by the user.

#### __SEARCH:__

Search is a process in which, it goes through the index listings instead of searching through out all database documents.

The popular search engines of Full-Text Search are __*Lucene*__, __*Solr*__ and __*Elastic*__ search engines.

## __LUCENE__

* It is a full-text search engine library with high-performance which is developed in _JAVA_.
* It is a technique, that can be used for an application which needs full-text engine.
* It is also useful for cross-platform applications (mobile apps).
* Object Pascal, Perl, C#, C++, Python, Ruby, and PHP are the programming languages that have been adapted to Lucene.
* It is used by __Linkedin__, __Twitter__ and many more.

## __ELASTIC SEARCH__

* Elastic search is a __*Lucene*__ based search engine, which uses JSON based REST API for using Lucene functions.
* Elastic search is a search and an analytics engine.
* It is a document oriented database, which can store, search data quickly in a short period of time.
* It can deal with higher volumes of documents in a short period of time. This is because, it does noot search text or word directly, and searches in index instead.

## __SOLR__

* It is a search platform which is built using _Apache Lucene_.
* Many of the world's major websites use Solr to power their search and to use the functions of navigation.
* It is based on HTTP API.
* The features of solr are database integration, indexing, full-text search, and also it can deal with word and PDF documents.

__Differences between _Lucene_, _Solr_ and _Elastic_ search__

Solr | Lucene | Elastic search
---- | ------ | --------------
It is built using Apache Lucene | It is developed using only with JAVA | It is a Lucene based search engine
It can be used even without the knowledge of programming language (JAVA) |It can be used only if JAVA is known | It can be used with knwoledge of JAVA
Unlike Lucene, It cannot be used to build our own search engine | It can be used to create our search engines like text analaysis | It cannot be used to build our own search engine
It is based ob HTTP API | It is based on JAVA API | It is based on JSON based REST API
